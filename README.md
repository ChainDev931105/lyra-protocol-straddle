# Lyra - Contract Docs

This repo contains addresses of the most recent deployments of the Lyra Protocol contracts, along with all relevant contract ABIs and supporting documentation.

Contract addresses can be found in the `addresses` directory. They are split into json files for each network, as well as `real` and `test` indicating whether the contracts interface with Synthetix deployments, or use our mocked implementations. 

Contract ABIs can be found in the `abis` directory.

Documentation for all system contracts [can be found here](docs/contracts).
